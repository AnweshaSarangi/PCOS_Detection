## Detection of PCOS using Computer Vision and Machine Learning
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder affecting women's reproductive health. Early diagnosis and effective management are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a robust computer vision-based solution for detecting PCOS using ovarian ultrasound images, leveraging advanced machine learning models and preprocessing techniques.

### Project Description
The project aims to automate PCOS diagnosis using advanced computer vision techniques, which offer a promising solution to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Methods Used
- Data Collection and Integration
- Image Preprocessing and Augmentation
- Feature Extraction
- Hybrid Model Design
- Model Training and Validation
- Performance Evaluation
- Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art Models
- Hyperparameter Optimization
- Result in Visualization and Interpretation

### Technologies used
The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:
- Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
